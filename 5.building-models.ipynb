    "# Building Group-level Models\n",
    "We are going to see many more examples of group-level models as part of *Experimental Design & Optimisation*. However, at this stage, it is useful to give a sense of how we use the GLM to analyse our per-subject contrast images. Luckily, the group-level is much more straightforward because we do not have to deal with issues such as the shape of the BOLD signal, the nature of time-series data, or low-frequency scanner noise. As such, group-level GLMs are generally much simpler than single-subject GLMs.\n",

    "## Indicator Variables for Groups\n",
    "The most basic form of 2nd-level model contains indicator variables for modelling different groups of subjects. For instance, if we had 3 subjects from one group and 3 from another, our 2nd-level GLM (for a single voxel) would be\n",

    "where $y_1$ is the contrast value from the 1st-level for subject 1, $y_2$ is the contrast value from the 1st-level for subject 2 and so on. The design matrix contains no constant, with only a single indicator variable coding group 1 and a single indicator variable coding group 2. This lack of a constant is due to SPM using a *cell means* approach to modelling groups at the 2nd-level. The main benefit of this method is that the GLM parameters become the *means of the groups*. In the notation above, the parameters have been renamed to $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$ to make this clearer. The parameter estimates for this model at this voxel will then be the average contrast value for group 1 and the average contrast value for group 2. We can then compare the group means at every voxel using the hypothesis testing framework already established.\n",
