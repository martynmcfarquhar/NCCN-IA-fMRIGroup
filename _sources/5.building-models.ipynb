    "# Building Group-level Models\n",
    "We are going to see many more examples of group-level models as part of *Experimental Design & Optimisation*. However, at this stage, it is useful to give a sense of how we use the GLM to analyse our per-subject contrast images. Luckily, the group-level is much more straightforward because we do not have to deal with issues such as the shape of the BOLD signal, the nature of time-series data, or low-frequency scanner noise. As such, group-level GLMs are generally much simpler than single-subject GLMs.\n",
