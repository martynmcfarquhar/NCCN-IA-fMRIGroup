    "# Introduction\n",
    "We have already seen how to use the GLM to analyse fMRI data from a single-subject, but it is rare that we are interested in only one subject. Typically, we have a group of subjects, or perhaps multiple groups of subjects, that we wish to compare. In this lesson, we will see how we can use the GLM framework to help us combine the results from multiple subjects into a single group-level analysis. This usually represents our final aim when analysing fMRI data, and thus will draw to a close the process of taking raw fMRI data and turning it into results ready for publication.\n",
