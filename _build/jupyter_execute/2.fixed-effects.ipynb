    "# Fixed-effects: The Wrong Way\n",
    "As described in the last section, if our interest is only on a single-subject then the variance we need to take into account is the *within-subject*. To put this into context, when we fit a single-subject GLM using SPM, the variance calculated from that model *is* the within-subject variance. This is because it is based on the errors of the GLM, which represent discrepancies between the measured time-series and the predicted time-series for that individual subject. This is the same as considering the spread of data around the subject's own mean. Our hypothesis tests are then built using test statistics that use the within-subject variance, and so all our inference is based on the internal consistency of that one subject. This is perfectly valid, and reflects the fact that inference at the 1st-level is only relevant for that one subject and nobody else.\n",

    "## Stacking Multiple Subjects at the 1st-level\n",
    "Early approaches to analysing fMRI data from multiple subjects involved expanding upon inference at the 1st-level by concatenating the data from multiple subjects. As an example, the design matrix shown in {numref}`ffx-glm-fig` involves stacking the individual 1st-level models for 10 subjects, and then using a contrast to average across the subjects to test for group effects.\n",

    "where the indices correspond to individual subjects and $\\mathbf{0}$ refers to a sub-matrix of all zeros. As we can see, the errors in this model are just a stack of the errors from the individual single-subject models. As we know, these represent within-subject errors, because they tell us the discrepancies between the raw data and the model for each subject. The overall model variance for this big GLM is therefore the *average within-subject variance* from across the subjects. This means that any hypothesis tests from this model will use the average within-subject variance for inference. What this does not do is take the *between-subject* variance into account which, as we have established, is the most important element for making inference about a group of subjects. As such, there is nothing in this approach that considers this particular group of subjects as representative of a larger population of subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "In statistical jargon, if we do not treat subjects as being drawn from a larger population then the subjects represent a *fixed-effect*. As such, this approach is known as a *fixed-effects analysis*, sometimes shortened to [FFX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_X).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{important}\n",
    "The conclusion from this is that a FFX approach is *not appropriate* for modelling group-level fMRI data. Although it may seem somewhat harmless doing things this way, the issue is that the within-subject variance is generally much smaller than the between-subjects variance. As such, trying to use the within-subject variance for inference about a population leads to a *massively inflated false positive rate*.\n",

    "## What Use is a FFX Analysis?\n",
    "If we now know that a FFX analysis is inappropriate, why are we discussing it? The first reason is to make sure that you are not tricked into using a FFX approach by the `SPM` interface. You may recall when we specified single-subject models, `SPM` asks to you add a `New: Subject/Session`, which does give the impression that putting multiple subjects in at the 1st-level is the way to analyse multiple subjects. This is shown in {numref}`spm-add-sub-fig`.\n",
