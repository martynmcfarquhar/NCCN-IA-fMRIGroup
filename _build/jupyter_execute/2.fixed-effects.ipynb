    "# Fixed-effects: The Wrong Way\n",
    "As described in the last section, if our interest is only on a single-subject then the variance we need to take into account is the within-subject and nothing more. To put this into context, when we fit a single-subject GLM using SPM, the variance calculated from that model is the within-subject variance. This is because it is based on the errors of the GLM, which represent discrepancies between the measured time series and the predicted time series for that individual subject. This is the same as considering the spread of data around the subject's own mean. Our hypothesis tests are then built using test statistics that use the within-subject variance in the denominator, and so all our inference is based on the internal consistency of that one subject. This is perfectly valid, and reflects the fact that inference at the 1st-level is only relevant for that one subject and nobody else.\n",
