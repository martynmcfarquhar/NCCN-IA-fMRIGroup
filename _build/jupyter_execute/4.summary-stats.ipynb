    "# Summary Statistics: The SPM Way\n",
    "As mentioned in the previous section, the MFX approach is our ideal method of group-level analysis because it combines all sources of variance, allowing for the model to flexibly adapt to subjects with different degrees of variation at the 1st-level. Unfortunately, doing so, particularly within the mutlilevel framework shown previously, is computationally very challenging. This is why the original recommendation of [Holmes & Friston (1998)](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/doc/papers/aph_rfx.pdf) was to use a different method, known as *summary statistics*.\n",

    "## The Summary Statistics Approach\n",
    "Much like the MFX approach, the summary statistics approach starts with the hierarchical model we have seen previously. We still fit a 1st-level model to each subject separately, calculate a contrast of interest for each subject and then take those contrasts and use them as raw data for a 2nd-level GLM analysis of the groups. As such, the diagram we saw earlier remains relevant for *both* the MFX and summary-statistics approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the MFX model, the difficulty comes in trying to take the 1st-level variances and use them as part of the estimation of the 2nd-level effects. The summary statistics approach does away with this entirely by not taking the 1st-level variances into account at all. Instead, the summary statistics approach just estimates the 2nd-level GLM in exactly the same fashion as the 1st-level GLM.\n",
    "Summary-statistics justification\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does SPM justify throwing all this 1st-level information away? One reason is computational speed. Not having to use the 1st-level variances makes the summary statistic approach very fast, as it just involves using the same equations as the 1st-level. Indeed, this should be even faster than the 1st-level, as the number of subjects is generally smaller than the number of measurements in an fMRI time series. This means all the machinery we have already developed for single-subject analyses can be recycled for the group-level. Another reason is that the variance estimate from the 2nd-level will be based on errors that capture the spread of the individual subjects around the group means. As such, this approach will correctly calculate the between-subjects variance and thus is suitable for making inference about the wider population. Finally, if you are willing to assume that the single-subject variances from the 1st-level are identical across subjects, then there is no need for a mixed-effects approach because the subjects will all be weighted the same in the analysis. Furthermore, the mixed-effects variance would simplify to"
