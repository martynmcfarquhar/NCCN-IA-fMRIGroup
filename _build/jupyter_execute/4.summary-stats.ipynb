    "# Summary Statistics: The SPM Way\n",
    "As mentioned in the previous section, the MFX approach is our ideal method of group-level analysis because it combines all sources of variance, allowing for the model to flexibly adapt to subjects with different degrees of variation at the 1st-level. Unfortunately, doing so, particularly within the mutlilevel framework shown previously, is computationally very challenging. This is why the original recommendation of Holmes & Friston was to use a different method, known as the *summary statistics* approach.\n",
