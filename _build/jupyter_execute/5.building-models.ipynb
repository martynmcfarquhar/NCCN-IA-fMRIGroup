    "# Building Group-level Models\n",
    "We are going to see many more examples of group-level models as part of *Experimental Design & Optimisation*. However, at this stage, it is useful to give a sense of how we use the GLM to analyse our per-subject contrast images. Luckily, the group-level is much more straightforward because we do not have to deal with issues such as the shape of the BOLD signal, the nature of time-series data, or low-frequency scanner noise. As such, group-level GLMs are generally much simpler than single-subject GLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Indicator Variables for Groups\n",
    "The most basic form of 2nd-level model contains indicator variables for modelling different groups of subjects. For instance, if we had 3 subjects from one group and 3 from another, our 2nd-level GLM (for a single voxel) would be\n",

    "where $c_1$ is the contrast value from the 1st-level for subject 1, $c_2$ is the contrast value for subject 2 and so on. The design matrix contains no constant, with only a single indicator variable coding group 1 and a single indicator variable coding group 2. This lack of a constant is due to SPM using a *cell means* approach to modelling groups at the 2nd-level. The main benefit of this method is that the GLM parameters become the *means of the groups*. In the notation above, the parameters have been renamed to $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$ to make this clearer. The parameter estimates for this model at this voxel will then be the average contrast value for group 1 and the average contrast value for group 2. We can then compare the group means at every voxel using the hypothesis testing framework already established.\n",

    "The main difference between a single-subject and a group-level GLM is that the raw data are no longer a time-series of BOLD values, rather they are *contrast values* from the 1st-level GLM for each subject.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameter Interpretation\n",
    "The use of *contrasts* as the raw data at the 2nd-level has important implications for intepretation. The trickiest aspect of this is remembering that the raw data at the group-level represent *differences*. As such, the parameter estimates are *average differences* and the group effects are therefore *differences of average differences*. Typically, a significant group effect means that the 1st-level difference was much larger in one group compared to the other. This could relate to effects in the same direction or effects in opposite directions. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{important}\n",
    "In order to be able to interpret the group-level results you must remember the *direction* of the contrast from the 1st-level. This will tell you what a *positive* effect means and what a *negative* effect means. This is the only way you can interpret what your group-level results mean! \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, imagine again that we had 1st-level models looking at the difference between `Faces` and `Houses`. For the group-level, we take the contrast `Faces` - `Houses`, to look for differences between the two groups. If we found a significant group difference at a specific voxel, we may decide to plot the group effects to understand what is going on. This is illustrated in {numref}`group-plots-fig` for 3 voxels where the group difference is significant. Notably, each of these voxels shows quite different effects. So how do we interpret these findings?\n",

    "The key thing to remember is that the $y$-axis in each of these plots is the value of the `Faces` - `Houses` contrast. A *positive* value therefore means that the signal for `Faces` was *larger* than the signal for `Houses`. Similarly, a *negative* value means that the signal for `Houses` was *larger* than the signal for `Faces`. The 0-point on the $y$-axis therefore indicates that the brain response for `Faces` and `Houses` was the same. In other words, *no difference* between these conditions.\n",

    "The plot at voxel C shows that the mean of the first group was *positive* and that the mean of the second group was essentially *zero*. This can be seen by noting that the confidence interval for the second group overlaps with 0. This result therefore indicates that there was a larger response for `Faces` compared to `Houses` in the first group, but that the response to `Faces` and `Houses` was *the same* in the second group. So here, the significant group difference comes from the fact that the 1st-level effect is *null* in one group but not in the other.\n",

    "These examples highlight the importance of trying to interpret our findings more carefully by looking at the actual pattern of results. In this case, we have seen three quite different interpretations that have all come from the same set of significant findings. In all cases, remembering the direction of subtraction at the 1st-level is key, as well as understanding the difference between a positive, negative and null 1st-level effect, in the context of the experiment. We will be looking at creating these types of plots in a future lesson, so for now just focus on understanding group-level models more generally. However, it is important at this stage to be thinking about the interpretation of 2nd-level models in this way.\n",
