    "# Building Group-level Models\n",
    "We are going to see many more examples of group-level models as part of *Experimental Design & Optimisation*. However, at this stage, it is useful to give a sense of how we use the GLM to analyse our per-subject contrast images. Luckily, the group-level is much more straightforward because we do not have to deal with issues such as the shape of the BOLD signal, the nature of time-series data, or low-frequency scanner noise. As such, group-level GLMs are generally much simpler than single-subject GLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Indicator Variables for Groups\n",
    "The most basic form of 2nd-level model contains indicator variables for modelling different groups of subjects. For instance, if we had 3 subjects from one group and 3 from another, our 2nd-level GLM (for a single voxel) would be\n",

    "where $c_1$ is the contrast value from the 1st-level for subject 1, $c_2$ is the contrast value for subject 2 and so on. The design matrix contains no constant, with only a single indicator variable coding group 1 and a single indicator variable coding group 2. This lack of a constant is due to SPM using a *cell means* approach to modelling groups at the 2nd-level. The main benefit of this method is that the GLM parameters become the *means of the groups*. In the notation above, the parameters have been renamed to $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$ to make this clearer. The parameter estimates for this model at this voxel will then be the average contrast value for group 1 and the average contrast value for group 2. We can then compare the group means at every voxel using the hypothesis testing framework already established.\n",

    "and can still create statistical maps that we threshold using corrected or uncorrected $p$-values, at either the cluster or peak-level, using FDR or FWE approaches. So everything remains exactly the same as we saw at the 1st-level. \n",

    "```{important}\n",
    "The main difference between a single-subject and a group-level GLM is that the raw data are no longer a time-series of BOLD values, rather they are *contrast values* from the 1st-level GLM for each subject.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameter Interpretation\n",
    "The use of *contrasts* as the raw data at the 2nd-level has important implications for intepretation. The trickiest aspect of this is remembering that the raw data at the group-level represent *differences*. As such, the parameter estimates are *average differences* and the group effects are therefore *differences of average differences*. Typically, a significant group effect means that the 1st-level difference was much larger in one group compared to the other. This could relate to effects in the same direction or effects in opposite directions, which we would need to be investigated using plots at different voxels (which we will cover in a later lesson). \n",
    "\n",
    "```{important}\n",
    "In order to be able to interpret the group-level results you must remember the *direction* of the contrast from the 1st-level. This will tell you what a *positive* effect means and what a *negative* effect means. This is the only way you can interpret what your group-level results mean! \n",
